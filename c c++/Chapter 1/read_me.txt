Declarations:
I am solving this excercise from "Let Us C" and putting it on git for easy access to myself.
Questions i have attempted are from the book "Let Us C" and any reproduction work should be done with the permission from the Publication and writer. This is not any attempt to reproduce the work of original writer but self study and analysis by myself.
In case if you (the reader) finds anything that may voilate copyright of any kind please let me know at vpanvalkar@outlook.com or here on git, i will take down the related material.

Introduction:
"C" is high level programming language and it has been around for nearly 5 decades( from 1972). It was created by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T's Bell Laboratories.
C is complied language and it has much similarity with assembly language. Execution speed of c programs give the very edge over any other language. Though there are many high level programming languages which are easy to read and write but none is fast as C.
Major uses of C:
    * Most of the drivers are written in C.(speedy)
    * Most part of Operating systems, embeded devices, smart devices get their programs written in C.
    * Ultra fast gamming and rendering requires speed and percesion which can be achieved with C.

Goal:
I have solved 7 problems from this chapter. In solving these questions i had my motive to understand basic contruct of "C program".
    1. Commenting in C programs.
    2. what is main, include, <stdio.h>?
    3. what are primary constants and how to declare them, scan them and print.
        * Rules of constructing primary constants.
        * Rules of constructing primary variables.
    4. keywords in C.
    5. Basic arithmatic in c.
    6. Use of scanf, printf.
Not in that specific order Though.:)
