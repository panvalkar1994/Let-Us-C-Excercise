Declarations:
I am solving this excercise from "Let Us C" and putting it on git for easy access to myself.
Questions i have attempted are from the book "Let Us C" and any reproduction work should be done with the permission from the Publication and writer. This is not any attempt to reproduce the work of original writer but self study and analysis by myself.
In case if you (the reader) finds anything that may voilate copyright of any kind please let me know at vpanvalkar@outlook.com or here on git, i will take down the related material.

Introduction:
While writing C program we go through a fixed process of adding preprocessors to program, declaration of main and then inner body of the program. In this chapter i got to know more about types of instructions goes in c program. Knowing types of instruction, Hierarchy of operations and conversion of mathematical formulae to C instructions gives more power to coder.

Goal:
In this chapter i learned about following key ideas:
    * Types of C instructions;
        1. Type Declaration Instructions
        2. Arithmetic Instructions
        3. Control Instructions.
    * Type conversion in assignments.
    * Hierarchy of Operations.
    * Conversions of mathematical formulae to C instructions.

Observation:
    * While writing any C program if we strictly divide the program in different sections, then visualization of programming structure can be easy, finding error or debugging will be smooth and readablity of the program enhances.
